Spotify.com Account Creator

Listen, the code is super bad I dont really wanna hear it. I made this in about 10-20 minutes at like 3 in the morning, being half asleep.
Anyways it of course could be improved, and my code could be cleaner but as I always say "I dont give a fuck how shit the code looks, as long as it works."
And dont tell me some bullshit about "omg bigboy messy code = slower code >:(((" because I wont fucking listen, because I dont fucking care.

Now another thing I would like to bring up is that I think this might count as an exploit? Idk. Basically what I mean is that the actual gen errors out because spotify knows that its bot traffic but for some reason if you send enough requests it just goes through.
Basically what I did to use this lil glitch is ignore all errors and just put threads super high. So when you run this program, put your threads anywhere from 500-2500.
Personally I used around 1500 which worked pretty good. Although at that time my proxy provider had 11k proxies in the proxy pool so it's really up to you.

Good luck have fun don't cry about how shit this code is ðŸ˜˜
